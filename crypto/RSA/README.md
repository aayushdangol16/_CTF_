# Challenge Name: RSA Decryption Challenge
## Description:
We intercepted some encrypted messages but lost the private key. We do have the public key and the encrypted messages. Can you help us decrypt the messages and find the hidden flag?
## Public Key:
e=207 <br>
n=1921
## Ciphertext:
c=[1223, 1733, 927, 1900, 1223, 1643, 132, 571, 1733, 1765, 182, 500, 1453, 182, 266, 298, 1225, 1453, 1765, 1192, 1225, 717]
